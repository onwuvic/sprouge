Slant, Flat and Animation UI Design<br>
Sprouge was inspired by outlook home page design. It has the combination of slant UI design, flat UI and Scroll-into-View animation (this feature differentiated it from the original outlook UI). It was design with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The slant was achieve using the new "SVG" and "POLYGON" HTML tags I just learn. <a href="http://fontawesome.io/icons/">FontAwesome Icons</a> was used for the logo. The Scroll-into-View animation was done with <a href="https://scrollrevealjs.org/" target="_blank">srollReaveal.js</a>. This job was done while listening to (Hillsong Young & Free - Only Wanna Sing) with a cup of Choco.
